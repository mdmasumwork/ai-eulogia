                           <p>We gather here today not to dwell on sadness, but to celebrate the life of an incredible person—Chris. To me, Chris wasn’t just a colleague or a friend. He was a constant, a person I could always count on, and someone who brought lightness and laughter wherever he went.</p>
                           <p>One of the things that always stood out about Chris was the way he looked out for me, especially at work. No matter how busy things got, he had a way of making everything seem easier—whether through a quick bit of advice, a shared laugh, or one of our many inside jokes. Chris had this ability to turn a stressful moment into something manageable. His presence was always a comfort.</p>
                           <p>One of our favorite pastimes was going to watch cricket together. Chris was a massive England cricket fan, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget his excitement whenever his team was playing. His passion for the game was infectious, and I’ll miss those afternoons, sitting side by side, sharing commentary and laughs as we cheered for England. Even when they lost, Chris kept the mood light—usually with one of his quick jokes or loud, booming laughter that made everyone around smile.</p>
                           <p>Chris’s personality was larger than life. His sense of humor was sharp, and he had this intensity that made everything feel more alive. Whether he was cracking a joke or getting passionate about something he believed in, you couldn’t help but be drawn in by his energy. People loved being around him because he had a way of making life more fun, more colorful.</p>
                           <p>Though Chris is no longer with us in person, I believe his spirit will always be a part of our lives. His laughter, his warmth, and his friendship will never fade. We’ll carry those memories with us, and in that way, he’ll always be close by.</p>
